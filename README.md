# MovieBox-TUI

A fast, lightweight terminal client for streaming and downloading movies, TV shows, anime, and live TV — powered by your local media player.

MovieBox-TUI replaces ad-heavy streaming websites and clunky browser players with a clean, keyboard-driven terminal interface. It scrapes stream links directly from multiple sources and launches playback in your native media player with hardware acceleration, audio track switching, and automatic subtitle synchronization.

## Features

- **Multi-Source Streaming**: Search and stream titles across MovieBox, 4KHDHub, BDIX mirrors, custom IPTV playlists, and community Stremio HTTP addons. Press `Ctrl+P` on the Details screen to switch providers in-place.
- **Hardware-Accelerated Playback**: Direct playback in `mpv`, `IINA` (macOS), or `VLC` with stream authentication headers forwarded automatically.
- **Automatic Subtitles**: Automatically searches, downloads, and syncs subtitles in your preferred language directly into your player.
- **Season Batch Downloads**: Download individual episodes or entire seasons with one keypress (`d`), with HTTP range resume support and clean folder structure (`Movies/` and `Series/`).
- **Interactive Settings Hub**: Configure your default media player, download folder, content modes, and themes inside an in-app visual modal via `/settings` (`Ctrl+S`).
- **Modes**: Switch between Streaming and Live TV (`Ctrl+T`), with community Stremio addons available directly as a streaming provider.
- **Ergonomics & Themes**: Full keyboard navigation (vim-style `j`/`k`, `/`, `Tab`) and mouse support (click, scroll, drag) with 6 built-in themes (Catppuccin, TokyoNight, Nord, Dracula, Gruvbox, Rosé Pine) and terminal theme autodetection.

## Prerequisites

MovieBox-TUI delegates video decoding to an external media player. Install at least one of the following:

| Player | Platform | Quick Install |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **mpv** *(Recommended)* | Linux, macOS, Windows | `brew install mpv` / `sudo apt install mpv` / `winget install mpv` |
| **IINA** | macOS (Native GUI) | `brew install --cask iina` |
| **VLC** | Cross-platform | `brew install --cask vlc` / `sudo apt install vlc` / `winget install VideoLAN.VLC` |
| **Android Player** | Android (Termux) | `pkg install -y termux-tools termux-am` *(launches external player)* |

## Installation

### macOS & Linux

Install via the automated script:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmad-abdullah-chaudary/MovieBox-Tui/main/install.sh | bash
```

> **Raspberry Pi & Linux ARM64**: Prebuilt Linux ARM64 binaries (`MovieBox_Linux_arm64.tar.gz`) are statically linked musl executables with 64KB page alignment, supporting Raspberry Pi 4B (4KB pages), Raspberry Pi 5 (16KB pages), and ARM cloud servers. Prebuilt binaries require a 64-bit userland (`aarch64`). On 32-bit Raspberry Pi OS (`armhf`), install via Cargo (`cargo install moviebox-tui --locked`).

*macOS users can also install via Homebrew:*
```bash
brew tap ahmad-abdullah-chaudary/moviebox-tui https://github.com/ahmad-abdullah-chaudary/MovieBox-Tui
brew trust ahmad-abdullah-chaudary/moviebox-tui
brew install moviebox-tui
```

### Windows

Install via PowerShell:
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmad-abdullah-chaudary/MovieBox-Tui/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Android (Termux)

Install Termux tools and the intent bridge, download the native precompiled Android ARM64 binary via the installer, and grant storage permissions:
```bash
pkg update && pkg install -y curl tar termux-tools termux-am
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmad-abdullah-chaudary/MovieBox-Tui/main/install.sh -o install.sh && bash install.sh
termux-setup-storage
```

> **Video Playback on Android**: Playback on Android is handled by external video player apps (**VLC**, **MX Player**, **Just Player**, or **MPV Android APK**) launched via an Android `ACTION_VIEW` Intent. Installing CLI `mpv` inside Termux (`pkg install mpv`) provides terminal/audio-only output because Android does not expose a desktop video surface to terminal sessions.

> **Android Player Selection**: The intent is dispatched through `termux-am`/`am` (preferred, enables MIME type, subtitle/header extras, and package targeting) with `termux-open` (chooser) used as a fallback. Select the Android player with `MOVIEBOX_PLAYER=android`, and optionally set `MOVIEBOX_ANDROID_PACKAGE` to prefer a specific app (e.g. `org.videolan.vlc`, `com.brouken.player`, `is.xyz.mpv`). Streams that require authentication headers (e.g. `Cookie`) cannot be passed to Android external players, so they stay headless-mpv-only; mirrors that only need `Referer`/`User-Agent` work through `termux-am` where supported.
